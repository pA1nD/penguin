{"content":"# Configuration in package.json\n\nThe package.json is used to configure the included components in the website. All components in\n`components/` are automatically included. To use third-party components (even penguin.js components)\nthey need to be listed in the package.json like this:\n\n```\n{\n  ...\n  \"penguin\": {\n    \"components\": {\n      \"Link\": \"penguin.js/link\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe key of the object is the name of the component with which it can be instantiated in a template.\nThe value is the path to the module. We use the nodejs resolution algorithm to find them.","doc-nav":[{"href":"/docs/getting-started","label":"Getting started"},{"href":"/docs/package-json","label":"package.json configuration"}]}
