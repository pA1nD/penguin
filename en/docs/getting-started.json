{"content":"# Getting started with penguin.js\n\nIt's easy to get started. penguin.js embraces the filesystem as its API.\n\n## Create and initialize a project folder\n\npenguin.js treats a website as a node-module. So create a directory and initialize it with a\n`package.json`.\n\n    $ mkdir my-site\n    $ cd my-site\n    $ touch package.json\n\nNow open the `package.json` in your favorite editor and add the following contents.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"penguin serve\"\n  },\n  \"penguin\": {\n    \"languages\": [\"en\"],\n    \"components\": {\n      \"Inplace\": \"penguin.js/inplace\",\n      \"Link\": \"penguin.js/link\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince penguin.js supports multilanguage websites you have to specify at least one language that you want\nyour website to be in. This is set as you can see in the snippet using `penguin.languages`. The\n`penguin.components` entry is a hash that lists all our installed third party components. penguin.js\nships with two builtin components that we just included. We'll see later what we can use them for.\n\nLast but not least we have to install penguin.js. Make sure that you use node v6 or higher.\n\n    $ npm i -S penguin.js\n\n## Start the development server\n\nNow that you created your project folder, go and start the development server using the following\ncommand:\n\n    $ npm start\n\nMaybe you noticed that this runs the `start` script that you declared in your `package.json` in the\nprevious step. penguin.js makes heavy use of these scripts like we'll see later. You should see\noutput in your terminal that looks like this:\n\n    > @ start /Users/domachine/Desktop/apps/github.com/domachine/my-site\n    > penguin serve\n\n    components.js written\n    > Ready on port 3000\n    331941 bytes written (1.74 seconds)\n\n## Your first page\n\nIf you visit http://localhost:3000/ you'll see a 404 page. That seems bad but it's good! It means\nthat you're ready to develop your website now! Creating a page in penguin.js is easy. Just create an\nhtml file like this:\n\n    $ mkdir pages\n    $ touch pages/index.html\n\nNow edit this file and add some content:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My first page</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Home</h1>\n    {@link href=\"/about\"}Link to about{/link}\n    {@component name=\"Inplace\" tagName=\"p\" field=\"description\"}\n      This text is editable\n    {/component}\n    <script src='/static/client.js'></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAs you can see, we're using some special tags here:\n\n    {@link href=\"/about\"}Link to about{/link}\n\nThese are [dustjs](http://www.dustjs.com) helpers that we use to mount components into our site.\nIf you checkout the page on your http://localhost:3000/ you'll see that the `<p>` is editable.\n\n## Adding a save button\n\nIt's nice, that we have an editable element in about 5 minutes. But how to save it? Let's add a save\nbutton for which we have a component. We're all about components :-). The first step is to reference it in your `package.json`.\n\n```json\n\"penguin\": {\n  \"languages\": [\"en\"],\n  \"components\": {\n    \"Inplace\": \"penguin.js/inplace\",\n    \"Link\": \"penguin.js/link\",\n    \"SaveButton\": \"penguin.js/save_button\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen add it to your page.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My first page</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Home</h1>\n    {@component name=\"SaveButton\" tagName=\"button\"}Save it!{/component}\n    {@link href=\"/about\"}Link to about{/link}\n    {@component name=\"Inplace\" tagName=\"p\" field=\"description\"}\n      This text is editable\n    {/component}\n    <script src='/static/client.js'></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIf you now edit your `p` and press save. Just refresh the page and you'll see that it's persistent.\n\n## Add a save indicator to your page\n\nAnother missing part is a response to the user if the site was saved successfully. In penguin.js\nthis is easy and so flexible 'cause hey: We've got a component. Again reference it in your\npackage.json. It's called `SavedIndicator`.\n\n```json\n\"penguin\": {\n  \"languages\": [\"en\"],\n  \"components\": {\n    \"Inplace\": \"penguin.js/inplace\",\n    \"Link\": \"penguin.js/link\",\n    \"SaveButton\": \"penguin.js/save_button\",\n    \"SavedIndicator\": \"penguin.js/saved_indicator\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis component has a simple functionality. It defines an html element which is shown when the page\nwas saved successfully. Checkout the `tagName` and the `className` prop to customize it.\n\n    {@component name=\"SavedIndicator\" tagName=\"div\" className=\"alert alert-success\"}\n      Hey, just wrote your stuff to disk, mate!\n    {/component}\n\n## Go and try it\n\nThis is just the start. We're currently working on making it easy to deploy your site. Stay tuned:\nWe're moving quickly!\n\nFor now you can build your website statically using the following script in your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build\": \"penguin pack && penguin build\"\n}\n```\n\nThen run `npm run build`. This takes your saved data and builts your website statically to `docs/`."}
